	<h3>Cool beans yo</h3>

<p>We would like to build a set of tools that play nice together for quickly and easily spinning up, spinning down, deploying, and un-deploying web-apps and all their many variants, composed of sets of docker containers. We would like to take the "branching is easy and cheap" idea from git, and carry it over to web app deployment.</p>

<p>We introduce the idea of an "App", which is a set of docker containers, very much like what is described in a docker-compose.yml file, but with more stuff, allowing Apps and their variants to be managed by git and git branches ultimately, but by a CLI directly.</p>

<p>We also introduce the idea of "Targets", which are like hosts, but also include information on how to "unwrap" Apps. These will usually involve managed clusters a la ECS, but can be single hosts too.</p>

<p>The goal is to create an set of tools that can manage an ecosystem of Web hosts and clients, with appropriate authorization and authentication (ex: junior devs cannot push certain apps to production Targets, and do not know database credentials used in production).</p>

<p>Under the hood, this will involve a CLI, an "App Registry" (not to be confused with a docker registry), and a reverse proxy, all written in Node.js 4.x</p>
