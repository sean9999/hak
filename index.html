  <h3>Orchestra</h3>
  <p>Orchestra is a set of tools that taken together make deploying web apps easy fast and cheap. This document describes it's major components, and concepts.</p>

    <h4>Components</h4>

      <h5>Command Line Interface</h5>
      <p>The CLI is for invoking common commands. It's API and usage is inspired by CLIs like npm, git, docker, docker-compose, rsync, and ssh. Indeed most of it's actions invoke one or more of those utilities.</p>

      <h5>Application Registry</h5>
      <p>This is a central service that acts as a global registry, keeping track of what applications in what state have been deployed to what endpoints.</p>

      <h5>Reverse Proxy</h5>
      <p>This is the only exposed container, exposing itself by default on port 80. It links out to as many apps as needed using standard docker linking. Those apps, in turn, may link out to dependant services (like databases), but the Reverse Proxy is only aware of the <em>ambasador</em> service (ie: the web server). When a new Application is deployed to a new Target, that target stops accepting connections on one instance of it's Reverse Proxy, drains any remaining connections, and spins up a new Reverse Proxy with the newly added Application linked in. This should all happen in a failure tolerant, zero-downtime way</p>

      <!--
      <h5>Shelbot</h5>
      <p>This is the robotic identity that performs actions on user's behalf. It has SSH access to Target machines, a github (or gitlab) account, and PGP keys for transfering encrypted information to and from Orchestra users</p>
